This software requires Apache, PHP and MySQL to run.  Assuming you have those
things working follow these steps:
 
1) expand this tar file such that the "callers" directory ends up under the
   webroot.  On Fedora this means that "callers" should end up under 
   "/var/www/html/callers".
   
2) Create a database called "ae_db" that the user to be used, "atheist" in 
   this case, has access to.  In MySQL this is done commands such as
   the following:
   mysql> create database ae_db;
   mysql> grant all on ae_db.* to atheist@localhost identified by 'the_password';
   
4) Edit include/database.php to set the password specified above. 

4) View "index.php" in your browser.  That is, look at 
   http://atheist-experience.org/callers
   
5) For the host set the home page to:
   http://atheist-experience.org/callers/list

6) For the call screener set the home page to:
   http://atheist-experience.org/callers/screener

7) Optionally configure the password protection offered by the .htacces files
   in the "list" and "screener" subdirectories.
