This software requires Apache, PHP and MySQL to run.  Assuming you have those
things working follow these steps:

1) expand this tar file such that the "callers" directory ends up under the
   webroot.  On Fedora this means that "callers" should end up under
   "/var/www/html/callers".

2) Create a database called "cl_db" that the user to be used, "cl_user" in
   this case, has access to.  In MySQL this is done commands such as
   the following:
   mysql> create database cl_db;
   mysql> grant all on cl_db.* to cl_user@cl_domain identified by \
      'cl_password';

4) Edit include/settings.php to set the password specified above.

5) View "index.php" in your browser.  That is, look at
   http://cl_domain/callers

6) For the host set the home page to:
   http://cl_domain/callerlist/list/
   It's important to keep in mind that although the above will redirect to
   list/index.html the later should not to bookmarked since the original URL
   invokes list/index.php, which does required security checks.

7) For the call screener set the home page to:
   http://cl_domain/callers/screener

8) Optionally configure the password protection offered by the .htaccess files
   in the "list" and "screener" subdirectories.

9) If step 7) is pursued make sure the Apache is configured to allow basic
   auth.  You may need to add something like the following to the main
   configuration file, or it its own configuration file:

  # Allow CallerList to do basic authentication and to limit users from viewing
  # the "include" directory".
  <Directory /var/www/html/callerlist>
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
  </Directory>

  This directory contains a sample "callerlist.conf" that can be placed in
  /etc/httpd/conf.d.

10) Ideally magic quoting should be turned off.  But this application will
   work either way.  To turn magic quoting off in a particular directory
   add this to the .htacess file:
    # Turn magic quoting off.
    php_flag magic_quotes_gpc Off
   If that does not work you can edit php*.ini:
    magic_quotes_gpc = Off
