    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>CallerList was written by members of
      the <a href="http://atheist-community.org/">Atheist Community of
      Austin</a> in order to help with call screening for their live call in
      public access TV show "<a href="http://atheist-experience.org/">The
      Atheist Experience</a>".  Please see the <a href="#credits">cedits</a>
      section for additional details </p>
    <p>CallerList is a LAMP and AJAX based application that consists of one
      web interface for the "screener" (person who does caller data entry) and
      for the "crew" (people such as the host of the show who answer the calls
      on air).</p>
    <p>The included callerlist.css file may be adjusted according to your
  preference.</p>
    <p>See the "INSTALL" file for information on setting up this
      software.</p>

    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>This software is subject to GPLv2 and later.  See the "LICENSE" file for
  information on the license.</p>
    <h2>
      <a id="credits">Credits</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The original concept and implementation was by Linda Raymond of
      Houston, TX.  Steven Elliott &lt;selliott4@austin.rr.com&gt; of Austin,
      TX rewrote CallerList.  It was HTML form and post based.  It is now AJAX
      based.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>CallerList uses JavaScript extensively.  Although a relatively new
      browser is required multiple browser vendors are supported.  The
      following has been tested successfully.:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chrome 4.0.249.30</li>
      <li>Firefox 3.5.9</li>
      <li>Internet Explorer 8</li>
      <li>Nexus One 2.1-update1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully any version of PHP 5 works, but only PHP 5.2 has been
      tested.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>The installation instructions are in the the INSTALL file in this
       directory.</p>
    <h2>Help</h2>
    <p>The host and screener pages are similar.  For the most part the
      screener's page is a writable version of the host page with some
      additional features.  This help begins by discussing some of the
      elements on each page and then ends with some information about key
      bindings for the screener.</p>
    <h3>Fields</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Modified</dt>
      <dd>This is the time that the screener last made some change to the
        database.  Seeing this value can reassure the crew that the screener
        is actively working.</dd>
      <dt>Time</dt>
      <dd>This is the server time rendered with the client's time zone.</dd>
      <dt>HTTP Status</dt>
      <dd>The last status received in the HTTP response headers.  200
        indicates success.  A list of possible HTTP statuses can be
        found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">
        here</a>.  This field turns red when there is an err (when the status
        is not 200).</dd>
      <dt>RTT</dt>
      <dd>This is the Round Trip Time from the browser to the webserver.  An
        increase in this value may indicate network congestion.</dd>
      <dt>Pause</dt>
      <dd>Don't retrieve new caller information unless the "Update" button
        is clicked explicitly.</dd>
      <dt>Sync</dt>
      <dd>When selected the client adjusts the delay between updates so
        that the updates are done on some multiple of the update rate.  For
        example, if the default update rate of every 5 seconds is used then
        when this is selected updates will happen at 1:00:00, 1:00:05,
        ...</dd>
      <dt>All (list page only)</dt>
      <dd>When selected the crew can see the last 100 callers in
        chronological order regardless of online status or priority.  The crew
        can use this when the want information on a recent past caller.</dd>
      <dt>Flash (edit page only)</dt>
      <dd>When the screener presses this button call clients turn red from 5
        to 10 seconds.  This is used when there is some urgent issue, such as
        the microphone being broken, where the screener needs to get the
        attention of the host quickly.</dd>
      <dt>Manual Update</dt>
      <dd>When pressed new caller information is retrieved rather than
        waiting 5 seconds.</dd>
      <dt>Caller List</dt>
      <dd>This is the list of callers.  For the list page this is the online
        callers.  For the edit page a fixed list of lines is displayed.</dd>
      <dt>Message</dt>
      <dd>This final field is used for the screener to send messages to the
        crew.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>List Page</h3>
    <p>There are a few special key bindings for the list page.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>P</dt>
      <dd>Toggle the "Pause" checkbox.</dd>
      <dt>S</dt>
      <dd>Toggle the "Sync" checkbox.</dd>
      <dt>A</dt>
      <dd>Toggle the "All" checkbox.</dd>
      <dt>U</dt>
      <dd>Press the "Update" button.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Edit Page</h3>
    <p>It's helpful to understand what colors mean on the edit page.  When a
    caller is placed online (the button in the online column) the online
    button turns yellow.  When a field differs from it's original value it
    becomes a light blue.  When The field is exited and the result is to to be
    sent to the server the field turns yellow until the server acknowledges
    the change.  Consequently a buildup of yellow fields can indicate network
    trouble.</p>
    <p>There are a few special key bindings for the edit page.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
      <dd>If the control key is pressed with delete the message field or row
      is cleared.</dd>
      <dt>Down Arrow</dt>
      <dd>When a name or topic field has focus this places the caller offline.
      The call screener does this when the host hangs up on a caller.  If
      the control key is pressed with the down arrow the current row is also
      cleared.</dd>
      <dt>Escape</dt>
      <dd>When this is pressed edits to the current field are discarded.</dd>
      <dt>Return</dt>
      <dd>When this is pressed the changes to the current field are sent to
      the server.  Usually the call screener presses either the up arrow or
      simple exits the field.  If the control key is pressed with the return
      key all clients are flashed.</dd>
      <dt>Up Arrow</dt>
      <dd>When a name or topic field has focus this places the caller online.
      The call screener does this when queueing up a caller.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>TODO</h2>
    <p>This section mostly only concerns developers.  It gives an overview of
    changes that should be made in the future.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DOM XML API cleanup.  Currently the code does a lot of looping and
      ignoring of empty text elements.  It should just call
      getElementsByName() for the elements it needs explicitly.</li>
      <li>The PHP code should be organized.  At the very least the PHP code
      should be organized into functions.</li>
      <li>NLS support.  Figure out what needs to be done so that the PHP code
      can unravel percent encoded non-ASCII text.  UTF-8 should be used
      whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Godaddy support.  Figure out why no helpful information is provided
      for database connectivity errors for Godaddy only.</li>
    </ul>
