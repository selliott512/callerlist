CallerList was written by members of the Atheist Community of Austin in
order to help with call screening for their live call in public access TV show
"The Atheist Experience".  

CallerList is a LAMP and AJAX based application that consists of one web
interface for the "screener" (person who does caller data entry) and for the
"crew" (people such as the host of the show who answer the calls on air).

The included callerlist.css file may be adjusted according to your preference.
